# logictrace.ai

An intelligent developer tool that takes your source code as input, analyzes its logic, and generates detailed explanations along with visual flowcharts or sequence diagrams. Designed for developers, learners, and educators, this app helps break down complex logic into understandable steps â€” all powered by AI.

## âœ¨ Features

- Accepts code snippets in multiple languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python)
- AI-powered explanation of the code logic in natural language
- Auto-generated flowcharts or sequence diagrams from control flow
- Visual diagram rendering using Mermaid.js or Graphviz
- Clean, modern UI with real-time outputs
- Option to export or share results
- History of explained snippets (optional login)

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React.js
- CodeMirror or Monaco Editor
- Axios for API calls
- Mermaid.js for flowchart rendering

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- OpenAI API (or any LLM for explanation + diagram generation)
- AST Parsing tools (e.g., Esprima, Acorn, Babel)

**Database**
- MongoDB

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- User submits code via a code editor interface  
- Backend sends code to OpenAI (or other LLM) with structured prompts  
- AI returns both:  
  - A plain-language explanation of what the code does  
  - A textual diagram (e.g., Mermaid or Graphviz)  
- Frontend renders the explanation and diagram for the user  

## ðŸ“Œ Roadmap

- [ ] Support for multiple languages (Python, JS, Java)  
- [ ] Export flowcharts as PNG/SVG  
- [ ] Add text-to-speech for explanations  
- [ ] Generate video walkthroughs (via Remotion)  
- [ ] Auth + user history dashboard
